These guidelines will help you to have your article published on Strapi. We do not post articles that don't follow our guidelines.

## Article
If you read this, you are interested by writing articles for strapi and that's great!
However there is some point that we want to clarify before you get into this experience.

Indeed we want to make sure that strapi articles are:

  - **Comprehensive by anyone, even your grandmother**
Our articles are written in such a way that a beginner as well as an expert can understand and reproduce the content of the tutorial very easily. A user facing a complicated tutorial will not last long and will be discouraged. Make it extremely easy to understand and follow!
  - **Explain everything**
All commands must be well explained so the user does not feel lost. Do not hesitate to say why you choose a specific technology, package, or service.
  - **Useful and practical**
We want to offer quality tutorials that prove to be really useful and interesting for others like connecting strapi with a frontend framework: "How to create a Trip Advisor project like with Nuxt.js and strapi"


### Structure

  - Title
  - Introduction, (what people will learn in this article)
  - Goals, (what people will be able to achieve)
  - Prerequesites, (what people need to achieve the tutorial)
    - Specify the version of Strapi (alpha, beta)  
  - Step 1 - First thing to to
  - Step 2 - Second thing...
  - Step n - Last thing to do
  - Include code source (github)
  - Conclusion

#### Title

We recommend using this format: **How to <accomplish a task> with <technologies>**
The title is very important, indeed, it must allow the user to know exactly what he will be able to do/find in this article. The user will be more interested by the goal of the article than the technologies used, think about it!

#### Introduction
The introduction is a key point of the tutorial. Indeed it allows to formally explain what will be:
  - **The goal of the tutorial or topic**
  - **What softwares are involved and why**
  - **Why the reader should follow this tutorial or topic**

#### Goal
This part does nothing more than explain the purpose of this article and what the reader will be able to accomplish at the end of it. Make the reader want to accomplish such a goal!

#### Prerequesites
If you are writing a tutorial, it is very important to list the prerequisites. The reader must be aware of what he needs to start the tutorial correctly.

#### Steps
This part defines the different steps of your tutorial and indicates precisely what the reader must do.

There must be an introduction for each step and a transition before the next one
All commands must be explained and must reside in their own code block. It is important to specify the path in which they are executed so that the reader is not lost.
  
It is also advisable to add screenshots. 

It is obvious to detail each script / code that you include so that the reader can really understand its usefulness and subsequently customize it. As well as the link to the source code (Github)

#### Conclusion
The conclusion must summarize what the reader has just accomplished but also propose what he could do afterwards. Indeed proposing improvements, adjustments is a very good point. 

#### Do not forget to:
Add the word count at the end of your article - excluding the code.
Add a meta description for your article - [Here are few examples](https://themeisle.com/blog/meta-description-examples/) 
Create the images for your article - [Access the template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/984457206556704992) Duplicate the template and create two images for your article. Add your image and edit the title, icons, and emojis to best match your article subject. Use either "Tutorial" or "Ecosystem" category based on your article content.
